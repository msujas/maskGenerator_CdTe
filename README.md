A Jupyter Notebook for automatically generating masks for cosmic radation on the Pilatus 2M CdTe detector on BM31, SNBL, ESRF. Requires a series of images (~20) and filters by the standard deviation on each pixel.

The azimuthalMaskGenerator notebook can be used to remove cosmics from a single image, but it's probably less accurate, and won't work well with samples with poor powder averaging.
